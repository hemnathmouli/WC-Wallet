It allows you to use credit instead of paying money. The credits are added to the user's wallet from the previous canceled orders.

== Description ==

If you ever don't want to refund your money instead of use as credits for future purchases, here is the plugin. The credits will be added at a discount. This plugin is flexible with cart taxes and coupons.

= How it Works =
* A order is made with a payment
* When the user insists to cancel the order and the order is cancelled
* Now the order total has not been refunded instead added to the user's wallet for future purchase
* The credits will be subtracted from the wallet for every purchase, as per credits used.

= Features =
* User interface to add credits on cart page.
* Offer new user with credits as rewards to order.
* No need for refunds in the gateways.
* Automatic update total when credit is larger the cart total or when product is deleted.
* Send Cancel Order Request and let the admin refund the amount as Credits.
* Credits restrictions for users.
* To show users their balance, use `[wc_wallet_show_balance]` shortcode.
* Offer credits for new users.
* Check the history of transfers and also balance in My Account
* Dashboard Widget.

1. Ensure you have the latest version of WooCommerce plugin installed (2.2 or above)
